                    On this special day, I want you to know how truly blessed I am to have you in my life.
                    You are everything a perfect person should be - kind, genuine, patient, and beautiful inside and out.
                    <br><br>
                    Happy Birthday to one of the most genuinely special people I've ever known.
                    In a world that often feels complicated, 
                    your beautiful simplicity and innocence are truly rare—it's something so unique and refreshing, 
                    and I honestly admire it so much.
I'm wishing you everything wonderful today, and especially for the year ahead. I know how passionate you are about history and how much you dream of getting into JNU.
                      <br><br>
                    My biggest wish for you is that you achieve that dream and get to dive deep into the subject you love.
                    May this new year bring you one step closer to all your adventures, from the halls of JNU to all the foreign 
                    countries you've always wanted to explore. Never change that amazing, one-of-a-kind heart. Have the most wonderful day!
